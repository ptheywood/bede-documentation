Bede User Group
---------------

The Bede User Group provides an interface between the Bede user community and the Bede Management Board. It provides an opportunity for Bede users to give feedback, request changes in policies and procedures, and interact directly with members of the Bede Support Group. 

More detailed information about the Bede User Group can be found in the
`Bede User Group Terms of Reference <https://n8cir.org.uk/supporting-research/facilities/bede/bug-tor/>`_ 

The Bede User Group meets once per term. Below is a list of issues raised at previous meetings, with the actions taken by the Bede Support Group, the Bede Management Board, or the Steering Group. In between meetings, issues can be raise in the Bede User Group channel on the Bede Slack workspace.

     - Test queues for faster turnaround of test multi-node jobs needed. Multi-node jobs take a long time in the queue, makes development hard.
